\section{Introduction}
Cybersecurity is a critical foundation for modern digital infrastructure, and the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced both opportunities and risks in this space. LLMs are playing a more significant role in cyber defense workflows, offering support in secure code generation, threat detection, vulnerability analysis, and training.\cite{zhang2025}.
\\
LLMs have the ability to generate human-like responses and process complex technical queries, making them a valuable tool for developers. Some studies have shown that GPT-3 identified over twice as many security vulnerabilities in a codebase compared to a leading commercial tool, with limited false positives.\cite{Yao23}.
\\
However, the use of LLMs in cybersecurity also introduces many risks. LLMs can produce incorrect, biased, or misleading advice. \cite{OSF24} This can create issues in the trust, reliability, and safety LLMs have in automated security tooling.
\\
This paper explores two key risk areas in LLM security use:
\\
1. Bias/ inconsistencies
\\
2. Jailbreaking and Adversarial prompts
\\
We aim to evaluate whether or not LLMs are reliable tools in a security context.

\section{Background}
LLMs are language models with extensive parameters that understand and process human language, by modeling the contextualised text semantics and probabilities from large amounts of text data.\cite{Yao23} Through tasks like masked language modeling and autoregressive prediction, LLMs can generate coherent, context-sensitive responses to natural language prompts.\cite{Yao23}
\\
In a cybersecurity context, LLMs have applications such as vulnerability scanning, phishing detection, and the generation of secure code snippets.\cite{Yao23}
\\
Key terms in this study include:
1.Bias: when LLMs reflect unjust assumptions or provide skewed advice.
\\
2.Jailbreaking: when users manipulate inputs to bypass safety mechanisms or extract restricted information.
\\
3.Misinformation: incorrect or misleading content, often confidently generated.
\\
Security expectations for LLMs include accuracy, consistency, ethical compliance, and resistance to adversarial prompts. This investigation examines how well LLMs meet these expectations in a cybersecurity context.










\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Bias and Inconsistencies}
While inconsistencies in LLM outputs are a known behavior due to random generation, a couple studies have systematically evaluated how temperature settings and prompt phrasing affect the consistency of responses. The temperature controls randomness in model output. Low values (ex., 0.2) produce more deterministic results, meanwhile higher values (ex., 0.9) generate more diverse and creative outputs \cite{FactSet2023}. This investigation aims to see how the same prompt can get different results at various temperature settings, and how slight variations in wording can also influence output even at fixed temperature values.
\\\\
To do this, we will run a set of controlled tests using a fixed set of prompts (ex., “The students opened their…”) and see how the model completes them across multiple tries. We will compare responses at temperatures 0.2, 0.5, and 0.9 to try to find variability, and log the frequency of common answers. Additionally, we will slightly change the structure of the prompt (ex., adding context or changing tense) to see how sensitive the model is to phrasing.
\\\\
This study also incorporates an analysis of biases seen in model outputs when given culturally, socially, or politically sensitive prompts. For example, prompts like “The best leader is…” or “Typical characteristics of a woman are…” will be evaluated to see if the model reflects stereotypical or biased patterns. These outputs will be assessed using two criteria: content variation across runs and alignment with known social biases (ex., gender, race, or profession). LLMs trained on internet-scale datasets tend to inherit both intrinsic biases (from the data itself) and extrinsic biases (arising during downstream tasks), mirroring those observed in traditional statistical models \cite{Luccioni2023}.
\\\\
By doing this investigation, we aim to show the challenges of inconsistency and bias in LLM generated content, and to see how user settings and prompt design play big roles in model behavior. These findings will contribute to a broader understanding of how LLMs perform under everyday use and the importance of prompt engineering in mitigating unexpected or undesirable outputs.


\subsection{Jailbreaking(NEED REFERENCE)}
Existing research on jailbreaking LLMs has focused primarily on evaluating the effectiveness of differing attack strategies within a single LLM environment. Commonly studied methods include the DAN (Do Anything Now) method, Character roleplay, The Switch Method, and Reverse psychology prompts; all of which are designed to evade ethical or content safeguards imposed by model providers (Qin et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). These studies typically measure the rate of the model’s compliance, and analyse prompt tactics that can allow for harmful or restricted outputs.
\\\\
However, most prior work has limited their scope to English-language prompts, overlooking the multilingual dimension of jailbreaking. Research by Qin et al. (2023) investigates role-based jailbreaks but didn’t explore how language translation could’ve altered model behavior. Similarly, Wang et al. (2023) focuses on evaluating ChatGPT's performance in software security tasks under adversarial prompts, but their research is restricted to English inputs. Additionally, the OSF preprint (Huang et al., 2023) investigates a variety of jailbreaking techniques, but again, disregards the possible effects of language.
\\\\
This study addresses this gap by exploring the effectiveness of jailbreaking prompts when translated into different languages (specifically Chinese and Spanish). Rather than investigating new jailbreaking methods, we aim to utilise a variety of existing adversarial prompt methods across 3 different languages to assess whether LLMs respond differently depending on the language input. The novelty of this investigation comes from our multilingual focus, which will highlight any potential oversight in the current security research of LLMs that are primarily tested in English.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Investigation 1 --- Bias and Inconsistencies}
To investigate how biases and inconsistencies come to be in LLMs, we designed and conducted three controlled tests using the OpenAI Playground. The first test explored output variability by prompting the model with the same sentence to complete across different temperature settings to see how randomness affects consistency. In the second test we examined the model’s sensitivity to small changes in prompt phrasing while keeping the temperature constant. The last test involved submitting ethically sensitive prompts to see if the model exhibited social biases or triggered content filters. Each prompt was run 5 times and responses were recorded to find trends in model behavior.

\subsection{Investigation 2 --- Jailbreaking \& Adversarial Prompts}
5 different jailbreaking prompts were used which varied jailbreaking techniques such as character play and reverse psychology. 
\\\\
Google translate was used to translate each English prompt to either Chinese or Spanish, which were directly pasted into each separate LLM. We ensured that we refreshed the webpage and made a new chat for each prompt in an attempt to keep data consistent and controlled. Each response was scored according to the key below.

\section{Evaluation}
Overall, our findings highlight that while modern LLMs demonstrate strong safeguards in many scenarios, they can be vulnerable to specific prompts and have context-dependent inconsistencies.
\subsection{Investigation 1}
From Investigation 1, we conducted three tests to evaluate the consistency and fairness of LLM outputs under varying prompt and system conditions.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Test 1 (Temperature variation):} At low temperature (0.2), outputs were highly consistent (e.g., always “books”); at high temperature (0.9), completions became diverse and unpredictable, demonstrating that randomness settings strongly affect stability.
  \item \textbf{Test 2 (Prompt phrasing):} Minor wording changes—while holding temperature fixed at 0.7—led to substantial shifts in the model’s completions, showing sensitivity to linguistic cues.
  \item \textbf{Test 3 (Bias detection):} When given socially sensitive prompts, the model exhibited intrinsic biases (e.g., gendered assumptions in “The best leader is…”), and content filters sometimes blocked outputs (e.g., for “Most criminals are…”), indicating both bias and moderation behavior.
\end{itemize}
These findings show that LLM outputs can change significantly depending on system settings and prompt design, and that underlying biases can come about even in filtered environments. 
\subsection{Investigation 2}
From Investigation 2, we tested 5 distinct prompts in 3 different languages across 3 LLMs, resulting in 45 total responses.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Refusal (0):} 36\% of responses.
  \item \textbf{Vague description / ethical warning (1):} 29\%.
  \item \textbf{High-level explanation or pseudocode (2):} 9\%.
  \item \textbf{Functional or nearly functional code (3):} 27\%.
\end{itemize}
Key observations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Gemini 2.0 Flash} was the most permissive—50\% of its responses produced functional code.
  \item \textbf{ChatGPT-4} and \textbf{Claude} enforced stricter safeguards but still leaked code under emotionally framed or fictional prompts.
  \item \textbf{Overall secure responses} (scores 0 or 1) accounted for 65\% of all outputs.
  \item \textbf{Multilingual inconsistency:}  
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Prompt 2 was refused by ChatGPT-4 and Claude in Chinese but yielded code from Gemini.  
      \item Prompt 3 was refused in English by Gemini yet produced an ethical warning in Chinese and Spanish.  
      \item Prompt 5 saw more permissive (functional) outputs in non-English settings.  
    \end{itemize}
  These patterns suggest that translated prompts may more easily bypass safety filters.
\end{itemize}

These inconsistencies suggest that translated prompts may bypass filters more easily, highlighting a gap in alignment of safety mechanisms across different languages. This emphasises the need for increased guardrails to ensure LLM safety across global deployments.

\section{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item What do these findings imply for using LLMs in secure systems?
  \item Is ChatGPT reliable for developers seeking security guidance?
  \item Can adversaries exploit LLMs? How do AI guardrails work?
  \item Compare to other findings
\end{itemize}
